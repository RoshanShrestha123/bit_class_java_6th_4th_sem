### PACKAGE AND API
-->
A package in Java is a namespace that organizes a set of related classes and interfaces. Think of it as a folder in file directory (Library files in C or C++).
<p>
The Java platform provides an enormous class library(a set of packages) suitable for use in own applications. This library is known as the "Application Programming Interface" or "API" for short. Its packages represent the tasks most commonly associated with general-purpose programming. For example, a <b>String</b> object</p>

Packages are used for
-Preventing naming conflicts
-Making searching / locating and usage of classes, interfaces, enumerations and annotations easier
-Providing controlled access
-Package can be consideres as data encapsulation (or data-hiding)
```
### Package are divided into two categories
--> Built-in Package (packages from the Java API)
--> User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
